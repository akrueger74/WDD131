                Hi! My Name is Andrew Krueger and I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I am currently
                majoring in Cyber Security 
            </p>
            <p>
                This page was created because of my love for the Star Wars universe.
                 I wanted to create a map of some important planets inside the galaxy with brief descriptions. 
                 Each planet has been included in both the movies and in some video games as well.
             </p>
             <p> I've always wanted to do an interactive map of the Star Wars galaxy.
                It reminds me of my childhood game "Star Wars Battlefront 2" that I used to play all the time as a kid with my brother and friends.
                Creating this map proved more difficult than planned but I learned a lot of new things and also received a lot of help from my tutors and peers.
             </p>
