			<p>Tatooine is a desolate desert planet located in the Outer Rim, known for its twin suns and extreme heat. Despite its harsh conditions, it remains a crucial hub for smugglers, bounty hunters, and traders due to its remote location and loose law enforcement. The planet's surface is covered in vast sand dunes, rocky canyons, and small moisture farms that extract water from the dry air. Settlements like Mos Eisley and Mos Espa are infamous for their crime-ridden streets, housing shady cantinas, illegal dealings, and scoundrels of all kinds. The Tusken Raiders and Jawas are native species, often preying on travelers and scavenging old technology from the remains of starships and droids.<br/>
                    <br/>
                Tatooine is deeply tied to the Skywalker saga, as both Anakin and Luke Skywalker were raised there. Anakin grew up as a slave in Mos Espa before being discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn, while Luke was hidden on a moisture farm under the care of his aunt and uncle. The planet also served as a key battleground in multiple conflicts, including the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt’s palace. Despite its reputation as a wasteland, Tatooine remains one of the most iconic locations in the Star Wars galaxy.<br/>
